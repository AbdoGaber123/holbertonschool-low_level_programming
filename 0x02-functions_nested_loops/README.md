In this project, I learned about using nested loops, including header files, and writing functions in C.

* `0-holberton.c`: C program that prints `Holberton`.
* `1-alphabet.c`: C program that prints the alphabet in lowercase.
* `2-print_alphabet_x10.c`: C function that prints the alphabet in lowercase 10 times.
* `3-islower.c`: C function that checks for lowercase characters.
* `4-isalpha.c`: C function that checks for alphabetic characters.
* `5-sign.c`: C function that prints the sign of a number.
* `6-abs.c`: C function that computes the absolute value of an integer.
* `7-print_last_digit.c`: C function that prints the last digit of a number.
* `8-24_hours.c`: C function that prints every minute of the day of Jack Bauer, starting from 00:00 to 23:59.
* `9-times_table.c`: C function that prints the 9 times table, starting with 0.
* `10-add.c`: C function that adds two integers and returns the result.
* `11-print_to_98.c`: C function that prints all natural numbers from an input to 98, as follows:
  * Numbers are separated by a comma followed by a space.
  * Numbers are printed in order.
  * Input represents the number to begin counting from.

* `100-times_table.c`: C function that prints the times table of an input value, starting with 0:
  * If input is greater than 15 or less than 0, function prints nothing.

* `101-natural.c`: C program that computes and prints the sum of all multiples of `3` or `5` below `1024` (excluded).
* `102-fibonacci.c`: C program that prints the first 50 Fibonacci numbers, starting with `1` and `2`. Numbers are separated by a comma followed by a space.
* `103-fibonacci.c`: C program that prints the sum of even-valued Fibonacci numbers not exceeding 4,000,000.
* `104-fibonacci.c`: C program that prints the first 98 Fibonacci numbers, starting with `1` and `2`. Numbers are separated by a comma followed by a space.
