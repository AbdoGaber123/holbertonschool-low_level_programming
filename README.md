# Low-Level Programming and Algorithm - Hatching Out
This repository contains programs written for the low-level programming and algorithm track at Holberton School. In these projects, which occurred within the initial three months of the program, I was introduced to the C programming language. The specific list of projects contained follows:

* 0x00. C - Hello, World
* 0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while
* 0x02. C - Functions, nested loops
* 0x03. C - More functions, more nested loops
* 0x04. C - Pointers, arrays and strings
* 0x05. C - More pointers, arrays and strings
* 0x06. C - Even more pointers, arrays and strings
* 0x07. C - Recursion
* 0x08. C - Static libraries
* 0x09. C - argc, argv
* 0x0A. C - malloc, free
* 0x0B. C - More malloc, free
* 0x0C. C - Preprocessor
* 0x0D. C - Structures, typedef
* 0x0E. C - Function pointers
* 0x0F. C - Variadic functions
* 0x11. C - Singly linked lists
* 0x12. C - More singly linked lists
* 0x13. 0x13. C - Bit manipulation
